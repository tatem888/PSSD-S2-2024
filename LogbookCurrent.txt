Problem 1 - Inchworm

Design Thinking:

Initially, I though of two solutions to the problem. The first would involve creating a vector of 0s with 1s at every point where a leaf would be present. Then, i could iterate through the vector, and every time the inchworm was due to rest, It would check the corresponding value in the vector to determine if there was a leaf there. This solution would work, but i also thought that there could be a mathematical solution that wouldn't require me to check branches where the worm doesn't rest or where there is a leaf. I decided to focus on a mathematical approach, as it will likely be more efficient than the vector approach.

Troubleshooting:

I was able to implement the solution using the modulo operator to determine whether at each rest stop there would also be a leaf, and repeating this at each rest stop until the end of the branch was reached.

The main issue that I ran into was with the upload and submission, where I took some time to get the files and submissions in the correct format.
